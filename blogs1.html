<div class="heading"><h1>Get Started with linux CLI</h1></div>
    <h2>Whats is Linux </h2>
   <div class="content"> Linux is open source os just like mac and windows. In simple terms, os manages the communication between hardware and software  one of the most popular operating system Android is powered by Linux.
</div> <h2> Linux kernel :</h2>

  <div class="content">  the kernel is the main piece of the operating system that manages the CPU, memory and peripheral devices thus we can say the kernel is the heart of every os that manages fundamental stuff like interacting with hardware and so on.
    So Linux operating system or we can say Linux kernel this is the one piece of the whole that is actually called Linux.
</div>
    
   <h2> Get started with CLI</h2><small>(command-line interface of Linux ) or we can say using Linux terminal </small>
   <div class="content"> why command line over the graphical user interface
    so the answer is commands is flexible and offers more options that are not available in GUI mode
    perform more in just one command thus mean some operations are up to four screens deep in GUI in CLI just a command 
    CLI  is fast thus does not consume memory</div>
    
    <h2>get started with CLI </h2>
   <div class="content"> in Linux CLI you have to keep one thing in mind is that unlike windows command prompt Linux terminal is case sensitive.
<br>
    1. go to dash and type terminal
    or with command just click on clt+alt+t<br>
    the first thing that you see is something like this
    <div class="img1">
    <img src="assets/images/ss1.png" width="100%" height="200px"></div>
    so the first name is the username of the user and another one is the computer name or hostname that's so important when it's time for identifying computer over a network. 
    in this case shivam@shivam shivam is both user and computer name.

    <br> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">: </span>is a separator and the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">~</span> sign is shows that the user is working on the home directory
    when we move to another directory is will vanish or remove 
    and the $ is for working as a regular user when we work as a superuser or root # will appear 
    <div class="img1">
        <img src="assets/images/su.png" width="100%" height="60%"></div> now you want to work on a file you need to know in which directory you are in so tell about the present working directory you just need to type the PWD command when you log in you are in the home directory default 
    <div class="img1">
        <img src="assets/images/pw.png" width="100%" height="60%"></div>
</div>



<!--cd starts-->



<h2> creating a directory:</h2>
<div class="content"> or in a simple word for a folder 
    type<br><br> 
    <span class="code">
    mkdir directory_name
</span>
<br><br>

we can also create multiple directories at once <br><br> 
<span class="code">
mkdir directory1 directory2 </span> <br><br>and so on




</div>
<div class="content"> 
    <h2>changing directory :</h2>
    here we let know about cd  command 
    so using cd <br><br>
    <span class="code"> cd /bin</span><br>
    <br>
    it will move you to bin directory
    and so on you can also type subdirectory after the main directory<br><br>
    <span class="code">
    cd /bin/cat</span><br><br>
    navigate to any directory just have to type <br><br>
    <span class="code">
    cd /directory1/directory2</span>
    <br><br>in case you want to go previous directory type <br><br>
    <span class="code">
    cd ..</span><br><br>
    here you have give space after cd 
    it will take you inside cat directory
    using this you can move anywhere on the directory 
    or want to go back directly to home just type<br><br>
    <span class="code">
    cd ~</span><br><br>
    there ~ mean the home directory
    for going to root type<br><br>
    <span class="code">
    cd / </span><br><br>
    now you are in the root 
    <h2>just like in windows c:\ is the root for that here is / simply a root
    </h2>
    two more things about changing directory is the path  of the directory
    is first is absolute path is the path that is the proper path of the file such as 
    absolute path 
    <br><br>
    <span class="code">cd home/shivam/Pictures/</span><br><br>
    and a relative path is you are already in the home directory so you can go with
    <br><br>
    <span class="code">cd /Pictures</span><br><br>
    <!--cd closed-->
       
    <!--ls start-->
    <H2>Listing Directories</H2>
     showing list of files 
    type<br><br>
    <span class="code"> ls</span><br><br>
    it will show folder and files in your current directory
    but not show files inside the folder
    for show files and folder inside the folder 
    type 
    <br><br>
    <span class="code">ls -R</span><br><br>
     want to see with details 
    type <br><br>
    <span class="code">
    ls -al </span><br><br>it will show hidden files too
    <br><br>
    <span class="code"> ls -a</span><br><br>
    for only files with a details type 
    <br><br>
    <span class="code"> ls -l</span> <br><br>
    Shows in list with details (it will not show hidden files)
<!--ls closed-->

    <div class="img1">
        <img src="assets/images/det.png" width="100%" height="60%"></div>
</div>









<!--moving started-->
<div class="content">
<h2>Moving and Renaming </h2><br><br>
<span class="code"> 
mv file_name /dir1/dir2</span><br><br>
for changing name it will
same<br><br>
<span class="code"> 
mv file_name changed_file_name</span>

<!--moving ended-->






<h2>
Removing Directory </h2>
<br><br>
<span class="code">
rmdir dir_name</span><br><br>
note directory should be empty before delete it that you have to delete the first files inside it
for that type<br><br>
<span class="code">
rm file_name</span><br><br>
<h2>
man command </h2>
<br><br>
<span class="code">
man command_name </span><br><br>
example 
<br><br>
<span class="code">
man ls</span> <br><br>

man is stand manual that gives details about the command 

<!--sudo started-->
<h2>sudo command</h2>  
sudo command is for permission sudo is run as superuser i.e owner so some operation ask permission from the owner perform operation 
for eg
sudo mv filename /opt/
it will ask for a password after that it will perform operations 
note sudo is a software log thus is take logs .


<h2>history command </h2>
history for show history for commands that we used before
<h2>clear command </h2>terminal using clear command just type clear
<h2>copy paste in terminal</h2>
type ctr+shift+c for copy
ctr+shift+v for paste 



<h2>Now let us understand about file permissions</h2>
<div class="img1">
    <img src="assets/images/det.png" width="100%" height="60%"></div>

   <br>These details are
    in the first column there is written drwxrwxrwx
    are file-type and permission 
    thus the first word w indicates d is for the file is a directory
    r for read ,w for write, and x for executable 
    so first is rwx for owner second for the user group and third for all 
    the second column is the memory block 
    third is the owner of the file
    fourth is user group fifth is the file size in bytes and then time and date of creation and then the file name
    the file names are starting with . (period sign) are hidden files 
    for just hidden files type.

<h1>later we will discuss more about file type and operaton on it </h1>
<small>any currection or changes do let me know ping me anywhere from given contact</small>
